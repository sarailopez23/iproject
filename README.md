# Project 1 - ConAmor Co

This project is a website I built based on my enjoyment of matcha. It has gotten more and more popular over this last year, so I made the aesthetic of the page with this group of people in mind.


## Usage/Functionality

This page is meant for the customer to learn about our brand, look at the drinks we have to offer, and be able to order their drink.

For menu, there are pictures of each drink, descriptions, and prices.

For ordering, you are able to put in your information, as well as drink preferences(drink type, sweetness, milk type).
## Technologies Used
html, css
## Future Improvement

A lot more formatting would be a huge improvement (more columns, setions, margins, borders, etc.) I would have also liked combine the menu and order page, and then have a separate checkout page.
